## For developers

### Project setup for PyCharm
* Mark editor folder as `source folder`
* Right click on editor to start a `launcher.py` script
* Wait till pip install all needed libraries


### The order of system managers
To properly initialize `SystemManager`, you need to run core managers by specifying<br> load order and 
dependencies in system configuration files.<br>
You can find needed configurations in `<project-name>/configs/managers.json`
